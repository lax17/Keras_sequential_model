# WHAT IS KERAS ?
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

# Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:
Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

# Types of keras model
1.Sequential Model
2.Functional Model

# Sequential Model:
1.Linear stack of layer
2.useful for building simple models
3.simple classification network
4.Encoder-Decoder model
5.Treat each layer as object that feeds into the next

# We can summarize the construction of deep learning models in Keras as follows:

1.Define your model. Create a sequence and add layers.
2.Compile your model. Specify loss functions and optimizers.
3.Fit your model. Execute the model using data.
4.Make predictions. Use the model to generate predictions on new data.
